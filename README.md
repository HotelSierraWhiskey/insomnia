# Insomnia ðŸŒƒ

## About
Insomnia wraps [pyscard](https://pyscard.sourceforge.io/) and [APDU Utils](https://github.com/HotelSierraWhiskey/apdu_utils) up into one package. All of pyscard's RFID monitoring objects are abstracted into an `Insomnia` object, instanced of which can be used to decorate your functions. Sessions still take place inside pyscard's card monitoring thread, as they usually do. Just decorate your function, and use the dispatcher to communicate with your DESFire card. That's it. 


### Basic Example
In the example below, the `check_application` function attempts to establish an session with a card in the pyscard background thread. Using the `send` callback, it checks for the provided application ID on the card and returns a response. The session ends when the function returns.
```python
from insomnia import Insomnia
from insomnia.apdu_utils.application_commands import command_select_application

app = Insomnia()

@app.basic()
def check_application(application_id, **kwargs):
    send = kwargs.get("send")
    response = send(command_select_application(application_id))
    return response
```

### Example using Pre-Authentication
Insomnia's `authenticate` decorator should be used in cases where mutual authentication is required.

```python
from insomnia import Insomnia


config = {
    "key": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16],
    "key_number": [0]
}

app = Insomnia(config)

@app.authenticate()
def get_session_key(**kwargs):
    session_key = kwargs.get("session_key")
    return session_key
```
